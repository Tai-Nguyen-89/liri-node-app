# liri-node-app

Hello! Welcome to my LIRI app. LIRI is a command line node app, taking in input from a user and providing data. It's similar to iPhone's SIRI, but text command instead of voice.

LIRI allows you to search up information about a song using Spotify, a movie using OMDB, or even a upcoming concert using Bands in Town.

Instructions:
1) Open liri.js in the terminal.
2) Use one of the four commands and replace name with what you would like to search in quotes (" ").

    I. node liri.js spotify-this name (ex: node liri.js spotify-this "Pisces")

    II. node liri.js movie-this name (ex: node liri.js movie-this "Shaun of the Dead")

    III. node liri.js concert-this name (ex: node liri.js concert-this "Lacuna Coil")

    IV. node liri.js do-it
